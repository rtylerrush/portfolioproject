<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>Although being a student takes up a majority of my time, I do like to participate in
    other activities as often as possible, such as the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Learning Korean</li>
    <li>Watching movies and TV </li>
    <li>Singing and Songwriting</li>
    <li>YA Novel Writing</li>
    <li>Traveling (especially New York City and Seattle)</li>
</ul>
